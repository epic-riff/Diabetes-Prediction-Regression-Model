# Diabetes-Prediction-Regression-Model
This project contains a diabetes prediction model using logistic regression. It includes a Flask script and and a basic HTML/CSS script.

Diabetes is a chronic disease where the body doesn't produce enough insulin, and can cause many problems. 11.6% of the U.S. population had diabetes, which means that it's a very frequent problem.

This project uses a logistic regression model created using the Scikit-Learn framework to predict the chance that a person can get or has diabetes. This is paired with a Flask backend script that allows people to see their chances of getting diabetes.

The dataset used to create the model is: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iammustafatz/diabetes-prediction-dataset
